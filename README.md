## Neural Rendering
> Neural Rendering은 딥러닝 기술을 컴퓨터 그래픽스 렌더링 파이프라인과 결합하여 현실감 넘치는 2D 이미지 또는 3D 장면을 합성하거나 재구성하는 분야입니다. 전통적인 렌더링 방식이 복잡한 물리 법칙과 명시적인 기하학적 모델(예: 폴리곤 메쉬)에 의존하는 것과 달리, 신경 렌더링은 신경망을 활용하여 장면의 속성과 시각적 표현 간의 복잡한 관계를 학습합니다.

## Implicit Neural Representations
> Implicit Neural Representations (INR, 암시적 신경 표현)는 이미지, 3D 형상, 비디오, 오디오와 같은 다양한 신호를 신경망을 통해 연속적인 함수로 표현하는 딥러닝 기법입니다.
